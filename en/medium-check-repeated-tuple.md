## Challenge

Implement type `CheckRepeatedChars<T>` which will return whether type `T` contains a duplicated member.

```ts
  type CheckRepeatedTuple<[1, 2, 3]>   // false
  type CheckRepeatedTuple<[1, 2, 1]>   // true
```

## Solution

The idea behind this challenge is to check if the tuple contains repeated elements or not,
We have to take every single element and check if it is repeated. We will do this by inferring the first element and checking if it exists in the rest of the tuple.
We will infer the first element, `F` and check if it exists in the rest of the tuple by checking if the element extends the `Rest[number]` union.

```ts
type CheckRepeatedTuple<T extends unknown[]> = T extends [
  infer F,
  ...infer Rest
]
  ? F extends Rest[number]
    ? true
    : false
  : false;
```

If the first element exists in the `Rest[number]` that means the item is repeated, in the other case, if it does not exist, we will call the Â `CheckRepeatedTuple` again with the rest of the tuple in a recursive way so it will repeat the process of inferring the first element of the passing array again and check if it exists in the remaining items.

```ts
type CheckRepeatedTuple<T extends unknown[]> = T extends [
  infer F,
  ...infer Rest
]
  ? F extends Rest[number]
    ? true
    : CheckRepeatedTuple<Rest>
  : false;
```
