## Challenge

For given a tuple, you need create a generic `Length`, pick the length of the tuple.

For example:

```ts
type tesla = ["tesla", "model 3", "model X", "model Y"];
type spaceX = [
  "FALCON 9",
  "FALCON HEAVY",
  "DRAGON",
  "STARSHIP",
  "HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT"
];

type teslaLength = Length<tesla>; // expected 4
type spaceXLength = Length<spaceX>; // expected 5
```

## Solution

We know that we can use property `length` to access the length of the array in JavaScript.
We can do the same in types as well:

```ts
type Length<T extends any> = T["length"];
```

But going that way we will get the compilation error “Type 'length' cannot be used to index type 'T'.”.
So we need to give a hint to TypeScript and tell that our input type parameter has this property:

```ts
type Length<T extends { length: number }> = T["length"];
```
