## Challenge

Implement the JavaScript `Array.includes` function in the type system. A type
takes the two arguments. The output should be a boolean `true` or `false`. For
example:

```typescript
// expected to be `false`
type isPillarMen = Includes<["Kars", "Esidisi", "Wamuu", "Santana"], "Dio">;
```

## Solution

We begin with writing the type that accepts two arguments: `T` (a tuple) and `U`
(what we are looking for).

```typescript
type Includes<T, U> = never;
```

Before we actually can find something in a tuple, it is easier to “convert” it
to union, instead of a tuple. To do so, we can use indexed types. If we access
the `T[number]`, TypeScript will return a union of all elements from `T`. E.g.
if you have a `T = [1, 2, 3]`, accessing it via `T[number]` will return
`1 | 2 | 3`.

```typescript
type Includes<T, U> = T[number];
```

But, there is an error “Type ‘number’ cannot be used to index type ‘T’”. It is
because we don’t have a constraint over `T`. We need to tell TypeScript that `T`
is an array.

```typescript
type Includes<T extends unknown[], U> = T[number];
```

We have a union of elements. How do we check if the element exists in a union?
We can use `extends` keyword to check if `U` is in `T[number]` and if so, return
true.

```typescript
type Includes<T extends unknown[], U> = U extends T[number] ? true : false;
```
