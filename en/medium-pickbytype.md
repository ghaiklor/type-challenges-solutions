## Challenge

From `T`, pick a set of properties whose type are assignable to `U`.
For example:

```typescript
type OnlyBoolean = PickByType<
  {
    name: string;
    count: number;
    isReadonly: boolean;
    isEnable: boolean;
  },
  boolean
>; // { isReadonly: boolean; isEnable: boolean; }
```

## Solution

In this challenge, we need to iterate over the object and filter out only those fields that are assignable to `U`.
It is obvious that we definitely need to start from the mapped types.

So that we begin with creating an object that copies all the keys from the `T`:

```typescript
type PickByType<T, U> = { [P in keyof T]: T[P] };
```

First, we got all the keys from the `T` and applied an iteration to them.
On each iteration, TypeScript will assign the key to type `P`.
Having a key, we get the value type by using lookup types `T[P]`.

Now, applying a filter to the iteration will allow us to find only those that are assignable to `U`.
When I’m saying “filter”, I mean the key remapping in this case.
We can apply key remapping and check if the key is the key we need:

```typescript
type PickByType<T, U> = {
  [P in keyof T as T[P] extends U ? never : never]: T[P];
};
```

Notice the `as` keyword, it is the keyword that shows the start of key remapping.
After the keyword, we can write a conditional type to check the value type.
In case the value type is assignable to the type `U`, we will return the key as is with no changes.
However, in case the value type is not assignable to `U`, we leave `never`:

```typescript
type PickByType<T, U> = { [P in keyof T as T[P] extends U ? P : never]: T[P] };
```

That way, we made a type that filters out the keys by its value type.
