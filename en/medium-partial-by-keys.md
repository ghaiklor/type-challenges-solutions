## Challenge

Implement a generic `PartialByKeys<T, K>` which takes two type arguments `T` and `K`.

`K` specifies the set of properties of `T` that should be set to optional. When `K` is not provided, it should make all properties optional just like the normal `Partial<T>`.

## Solution

Okay, let's break down the challenge into three parts.

- Extract all the properties of `T` which are present in `K` and mark them optional.
- Extract all the properties of `T` which are not present in `K` and keep them as is.
- Merge both of the types mentioned above to get the answer.

Okay, how do we create a new type by picking all the properties from `T` except `K`?

That's right. We can use the `Omit` type utility exposed by TypeScript or create our own Omit type helper.

```typescript
type MyOmit<F, S> = {[P in keyof F as P extends S ? never: P]: F[P]}

type EverythingFromTExceptK<T, K> = MyOmit<T, K>
```

Now let's extract all the properties from `K` present in `T` and mark them optional. We can do so by using [mapped types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html).

```typescript
type OptionalProperties<T, K> = {[P in keyof T as P extends K ? P : never]?: T[P]}
```

Pretty amazing right?
Now that we have both parts of our solution, let's merge them.

```typescript
type PartialByKeys<T, K = keyof T> = OptionalProperties<T, K> & EverythingFromTExceptK<T, K>
```

Note that this still does not solve our problem. Taking a closer look at the generated type, we can see `PartialByKeys` spits out `{...properties} & {...some other properties}`. So to reach our final answer, we will have to merge both the types into one singular type.

```typescript
type MyMerge<T> = {[P in keyof T]: T[P]}

type PartialByKeys<T, K = keyof T> = MyMerge<OptionalProperties<T, K> & EverythingFromTExceptK<T, K>>
```
