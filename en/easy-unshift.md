## Challenge

Implement the type version of `Array.unshift()`.
For example:

```typescript
type Result = Unshift<[1, 2], 0>; // [0, 1, 2]
```

## Solution

This one has a lot in common with the [Push challenge](./easy-push.md).
There we were using variadic tuple types to get all the elements from an array.

Here we do pretty the same, but in a different order.
First, let us take all the elements from the incoming array:

```typescript
type Unshift<T, U> = [...T];
```

With this snippet, we are getting the compilation error “A rest element type must be an array type”.
Let us fix the error by adding a constraint over the type parameter:

```typescript
type Unshift<T extends unknown[], U> = [...T];
```

Now, we have the same array as the incoming one.
All we need is to add an element to the beginning of the tuple.
Let’s do just that:

```typescript
type Unshift<T extends unknown[], U> = [U, ...T];
```

That way, we made an “unshift” function in the type system!
