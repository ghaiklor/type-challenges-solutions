## Challenge

Sometimes, you may want to lookup for a type in a union by their attributes.

In this challenge, we would like to get the corresponding type by searching for the common `type` field in the union `Cat | Dog`.
In other words, we will expect to get `Dog` for `LookUp<Dog | Cat, 'dog'>` and `Cat` for `LookUp<Dog | Cat, 'cat'>` in the following example:

```ts
interface Cat {
  type: "cat";
  breeds: "Abyssinian" | "Shorthair" | "Curl" | "Bengal";
}

interface Dog {
  type: "dog";
  breeds: "Hound" | "Brittany" | "Bulldog" | "Boxer";
  color: "brown" | "white" | "black";
}

type MyDogType = LookUp<Cat | Dog, "dog">; // expected to be `Dog`
```

## Solution

At first, I thought it will be a huge solution with a lot of explanations, but turns out nothing out of ordinary.

We know about [Conditional Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#conditional-types) in TypeScript and we know that we can use it to check if the type is assignable to some specific layout (if I may say so).

Let us check if `U` is assignable to the `{ type: T }` then:

```ts
type LookUp<U, T> = U extends { type: T } ? U : never;
```

BTW, worth noting that Conditional Types in TypeScript are [distributive](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html#distributive-conditional-types).
So that each item from the union is going to be checked against our condition.
