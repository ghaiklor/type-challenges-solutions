## Challenge

Implement the `Absolute` type.
A type that take `string`, `number` or `bigint`.
The output should be a positive number string.

For example:

```typescript
type Test = -100;
type Result = Absolute<Test>; // expected to be "100"
```

## Solution

The easiest way to make a number absolute is to convert it to string and remove the “-” sign.
I’m not joking, literally.
Remove the “-” sign.

We can approach it by checking if the type has a “-” sign in its template literal type, and if so, we infer the part without the “-” sign, otherwise return the type itself:

```typescript
type Absolute<T extends number | string | bigint> = T extends `-${infer N}` ? N : T;
```

So, e.g. if we provide the type `T = “-50”`, it will match the `“-<N>”`, where `N` will become just “50”.
That’s how it works.

Now, we can see that some tests are still failing.
That is because we do not return strings every time.
When providing a positive number, it will not match the literal type and return the number, but we need to return a string.

Let us fix that by wrapping our `T` in template literal type:

```typescript
type Absolute<T extends number | string | bigint> = T extends `-${infer N}` ? N : `${T}`;
```

Still, some tests are failing.
We do not handle the case when `T` is a negative number.
Number will not match the template literal type of condition, so it will return the negative number as a string.
To overcome this, we can convert the number to string:

```typescript
type Absolute<T extends number | string | bigint> = `${T}` extends `-${infer N}` ? N : `${T}`;
```

As a result, we got a type that takes any `number`, `string`, `bigint` and converts it to the string.
Afterwards, infers the number without “-” sign and returns it or just returns the string without changes.
