## Challenge

Implement the built-in `Exclude<T, U>`.
Exclude from `T` those types that are assignable to `U`.
For example:

```ts
type T0 = Exclude<"a" | "b" | "c", "a">; // expected "b" | "c"
type T1 = Exclude<"a" | "b" | "c", "a" | "b">; // expected "c"
```

## Solution

The important detail here is a knowledge that conditional types in TypeScript are [distributive](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#distributive-conditional-types).

So that when you are writing the construct `T extends U` where `T` is the union, actually what is happening is TypeScript iterates over the union `T` and applies the condition to each element.

Therefore, the solution is pretty straightforward.
We check that `T` can be assigned to `U` and if so; we skip it:

```ts
type MyExclude<T, U> = T extends U ? never : T;
```
