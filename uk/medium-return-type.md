## Challenge

Implement the built-in `ReturnType<T>` generic without using it.

For example:

```ts
const fn = (v: boolean) => {
  if (v)
    return 1
  else
    return 2
}

type a = MyReturnType<typeof fn> // should be "1 | 2"
```

## Solution

The rule of the thumb of using [type inference in conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-inference-in-conditional-types) is when you are not sure what the type must be in.
Exactly the case of the challenge.
We don’t know what the return type of the function, but we tasked to get it.

We have a function that looks in type system as `() => void`.
But we don’t know what must be in the place of `void`.
So let us replace it with `infer R` and it will be our first iteration to the solution:

```ts
type MyReturnType<T> = T extends () => infer R ? R : T;
```

In case our type `T` is assignable to the function, we infer its return type and return it, otherwise we return `T` itself.
Pretty straightforward.

The problem with the solution is that if we pass a function with parameters, it will not be assignable to our type `() => infer R`.

Let us show that we can accept any parameters and we don’t care about them by adding `...args: any[]`:

```ts
type MyReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : T;
```
